/******************************************************************************
  Demonstrates how to crack an encrypted password using a simple
  "brute force" algorithm. Works on passwords that consist only of 3 lowercase
  letters, hence the version name Lc3. Before you experiment with this program 
  you should explore CommandLine.c to learn about problems with "dollars" and 
  use EncryptSHA512.c to encrypt some passwords for testing.

  Compile with:
    cc -o CrackLc3 CrackLc3.c -lcrypt
	Use the "\" before "$" in your encrypted password in the command line when you run the program
  If you want to analyse the output then use the redirection operator to send
  output to a file that you can view using an editor or the less utility, for example (the plaintext for below should be "ali":
    ./CrackLc3 \$6\$AS\$8s/dt5uCaGNOKQy54QD1hV6cCFC8DNLugBNUivlWzTr84LiZUL.7c2.JCmSkFlHwaBqWeCFFXy/v9XoEw5KgW/ > output.txt
